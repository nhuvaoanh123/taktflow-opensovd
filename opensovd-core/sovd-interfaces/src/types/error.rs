//! Unified error type returned by every trait in `sovd-interfaces`.
//!
//! Downstream crates map this enum onto their own wire formats:
//!
//! - `sovd-server` maps it to SOVD HTTP status codes and error bodies.
//! - `sovd-gateway` forwards it upstream unchanged (possibly wrapped in
//!   `BackendUnavailable` if the routed-to backend is down).
//! - `sovd-client` deserializes SOVD HTTP error bodies into this enum.
