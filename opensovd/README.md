## Overview

Eclipse OpenSOVD provides an open source implementation of the Service-Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics (SOVD) standard, as defined in ISO 17978.
The project delivers a modular, standards-compliant software stack that enables secure and efficient access to vehicle diagnostics over service-oriented architectures.
By offering an open and community-driven implementation, Eclipse OpenSOVD serves as a foundation for developers, OEMs, and tool vendors to build, test, and integrate SOVD-based solutions.
The project will hence facilitate adoption and ensure industry coherence with the standard.

Eclipse OpenSOVD complements and integrates the Eclipse S-CORE project by providing an open implementation of the SOVD protocol that can be used for diagnostics and service orchestration within the S-CORE environment.
This integration ensures that diagnostic capabilities are natively supported in SDV architectures,
enabling developers and OEMs to build more robust, maintainable, and standards-compliant vehicle software stacks.

Key components include:

- SOVD Gateway: REST/HTTP API endpoints for diagnostics, logging, and software updates.
- Protocol Adapters: Bridging modern HPCs (e.g., AUTOSAR Adaptive) and legacy ECUs (e.g., UDS-based systems).
- Diagnostic Manager: Service orchestration for fault reset, parameter adjustments, and bulk data transfers.

Future-Proofing:

- Semantic Interoperability: JSON schema extensions for machine-readable diagnostics, enabling AI-driven analysis and cross-domain workflows.
- Edge AI/ML Readiness: Modular design to support lightweight ML models (e.g., predictive fault detection) via collaboration with projects like Eclipse Edge Native.
- Support for Extended Vehicle logging and publish/subscribe mechanisms.

## 🤝 Community Collaboration & Project Structure

Eclipse OpenSOVD thrives through open collaboration, shared responsibility, and transparent decision-making.
To foster this, we organize our work into dedicated work streams, each focusing on a major component (e.g.,
CDA, Client, Server) or a horizontal concern (e.g., Security, Testing, Eclipse S-CORE integration). These
work streams are led by community members who take ownership and drive progress in their respective areas.
To ensure coherence and alignment across the project, we hold a regular Architecture Board meeting, which
serves as the central forum for architectural discussions and key project decisions.
We invite all contributors and interested parties to join these meetings, share their insights, and help
shape the future of OpenSOVD.

Below are links to the current meeting invitations (as `.ics` files):

More work streams and meeting series will be added as the project evolves — stay tuned and get involved!
