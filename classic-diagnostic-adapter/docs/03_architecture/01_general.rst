Storage Access
--------------

.. arch:: Storage Access API
    :id: arch~system-storage-access-abstraction
    :status: draft

    The Storage Access API provides an abstraction layer for storage access, allowing the CDA to interact with different types of storage systems (e.g., local file system, databases) without being tightly coupled to a specific implementation.

    To achieve atomicity and consistent behavior across different storage implementations, the API defines the following semantics:

    * All operations must be atomic, meaning that either all changes are applied successfully, or none are applied in case of an error.
    * The API should provide a consistent interface for reading and writing data, regardless of the underlying storage system.
    * Error handling should be standardized, allowing the CDA to gracefully handle storage-related exceptions and errors.
    * Keys shall be handled case-insensitive, to simplify usage, and to avoid issues with different storage implementations.

    A transaction context shall be created through a ``transaction { ... }`` block, which ensures that all operations
    within the block are treated as a single atomic transaction. If any operation within the block fails, the entire
    transaction will be rolled back, and the result of the transaction will be an error.

    If all operations succeed, the transaction will be committed, and the result will be a success.

    Should an unexpected interruption event (power-off, reset) occur during a transaction, the transaction must be
    rolled back on the next startup, to ensure consistency of the storage state.

    For reading data, random access to the data must be supported, to allow for efficient reading of arbitrary chunks
    without needing to load it entirely into memory. This might be required for memory efficient handling of the
    diagnostic database.

    The ``get_or_create_collection`` function creates an implicit transaction for the creation of the collection only,
    if it does not exist. If the collection already exists, it simply returns it.
