Functional communication
------------------------

.. arch:: Diagnostic description & Configuration
    :id: arch~functional-communication-dd-configuration
    :status: draft

    Information about the available functional groups, the available services in those groups, and their communication parameters must be provided in a separate diagnostic description.

    The diagnostic description's MDD filename, in which the information for functional communication is contained, must be configurable. When no file is configured, functional communication is not available.

    A configuration option in the CDA can further filter the available functional groups from the diagnostic description.

    **Rationale**

    Extracting a standardized resource collection for functional communication from individual ECU descriptions is challenging and non-transparent when extracting common functional services from all ECU files. Therefore, we chose to do this via a separate diagnostic description file.

    This also follows the general pattern of one MDD file to an available standardized resource collection.

API
^^^

.. arch:: Functional Communication API
    :id: arch~functional-communication-api
    :links: arch~functional-communication-locks, arch~functional-communication-data, arch~functional-communication-operations, arch~functional-communication-modes
    :status: draft

    Functional group functionality - if available - must be available in the ``/functions/functionalgroups/{group-name}`` path.

    Within that path, a standardized resource collection (chapter 5.4.2 in ISO/DIS 17978-3) must be available, with the linked semantics.


.. arch:: Functional Communication ECU-Lock behavior
    :id: arch~functional-communication-locks
    :status: draft

    Locking a functional group will start sending functional Tester Presents to the functional DoIP addresses of all DoIP Entities, and stop sending non-functional Tester Presents.

    **Lock Options**

    There can be an option to restore the previous ECU locks (and their Tester Presents).


.. arch:: Functional Communication - Data
    :id: arch~functional-communication-data
    :status: draft

    **Data**

    Since functional communication returns data from multiple ECUs, the ``/data/{data-identifier}`` endpoint must return, within the top level of ``data``, the name of the ECU as the key, and only then its returned data (if any) as the value.

    In case of errors, the ``errors`` structures must still return the type ``DataError[]``. Inside a ``DataError``, the JSON pointer must always point to the ``data/{ecu-name}/...`` element (including the ECU name), or, in case of communication/timeout errors, just to the ECU entry ``/data/{ecu-name}``. A regular GenericError response with a failing HTTP status code (4xx, 5xx) is only acceptable when no communication was performed and the request failed beforehand.

    .. note::
       The content-type ``application/octet-stream`` is only supported for requests.


.. arch:: Functional Communication - Operations
    :id: arch~functional-communication-operations
    :status: draft

    Same principle as with data, except that the top-level element name is ``parameters``.

    .. note::
       The content-type ``application/octet-stream`` is only supported for requests.


.. arch:: Functional Communication - Modes
    :id: arch~functional-communication-modes
    :status: draft

    The following modes must be supported for functional groups when the underlying diagnostic description contains them:

     1. session
     2. dtcsetting
     3. commctrl
