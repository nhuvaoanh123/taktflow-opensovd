Flash-API
---------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flashing via UDS generally follows the following sequence. OEMs might choose to call additional services or modify the sequence.

.. uml:: /03_architecture/02_sovd-api/03_extensions/01_flashing_sequence.puml

To allow the flashing functionality shown above, the SOVD-API from ISO 17978-3 needs to be extended with the functionality defined in this document.

The standard doesn't define how the required services should be mapped in the Classic Diagnostic Adapter.

API
^^^

.. arch:: Management of flash files
    :id: arch~sovd-api-flash-file-management
    :status: draft

    **Motivation**

    To flash an ECU, the CDA needs to have access to the files that should be flashed. This API allows listing the files that are available for flashing.

    **Endpoints**

    .. list-table:: Flash file management
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Method
         - Path
         - Description
         - Notes
       * - GET
         - /apps/sovd2uds/bulk-data/flashfiles
         - Returns a list of entries that represent files in the configured flash folder and its subfolders.
         - Flash folder needs to be configured


.. arch:: Flash data transfer
    :id: arch~sovd-api-flash-data-transfer
    :status: draft

    **Motivation**

    To flash an ECU, the CDA needs to be able to transfer the flash data to the ECU. This API allows transferring the
    data in block-sized chunks, as required by UDS.

    **Endpoints**

    All paths are prefixed with ``/components/{ecu-name}``.

    .. list-table:: Flash data transfer endpoints
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Method
         - Path
         - Description
         - Notes
       * - PUT
         - /x-sovd2uds-download/requestdownload
         - Calls the RequestDownload service 34~16~
         - Returns the response of the RequestDownload service
       * - POST
         - /x-sovd2uds-download/flashtransfer
         - Transfers data in the file given by ``id`` from an offset for a given length, using configurable
           chunk sizes (block size), and a configurable starting sequence number. It uses repeated calls
           to service 36~16~ to transfer the data.
         - Returns an object with an ``id`` to be used to retrieve status
           Plans: The API will be extended to also allow starting the transfer directly with absolute file paths
       * - GET
         - /x-sovd2uds-download/flashtransfer
         - Retrieve the ids of the running flash transfers
         - --
       * - GET
         - /x-sovd2uds-download/flashtransfer/{id}
         - Retrieve the status of the transfer with ``id``
         - --
       * - PUT
         - /x-sovd2uds-download/transferexit
         - Calls the RequestTransferExit service 37~16~
         - Returns the response of the RequestTransferExit service

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. arch:: Flash folder configuration
    :id: arch~sovd-api-flash-folder-configuration
    :status: draft

    **Motivation**

    The CDA needs to know where to find the files that should be flashed to the ECUs. This configuration allows setting
    the flash folder.

    **Configuration Parameter**

    The following configuration parameter must be available in the CDA configuration:

    - ``flash_files_path``: Path to the folder where flash files are stored. The CDA must search this folder and its
        subfolders for files available through the ``bulk-data/flashfiles`` endpoints.
