UDS Communication (DoIP)
------------------------

The UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) application layer sits above the DoIP transport
layer and implements the request-response protocol defined in ISO 14229. It handles
service payload construction, response matching, negative response code processing,
tester present session keepalive, and functional group communication.

Communication parameters control timing, retry behavior, and tester present generation.
These are sourced from the diagnostic database (MDD files) and may vary per logical link.


Communication Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. arch:: UDS Communication Parameters
    :id: arch~uds-communication-parameters
    :status: draft

    The UDS application layer is parameterized through a set of communication parameters
    (COM parameters) that control response timeouts, NRC handling policies, and tester
    present behavior. These parameters are sourced from the diagnostic database (MDD files)
    and can vary per logical link.

Request-Response Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. arch:: UDS Request-Response Flow
    :id: arch~uds-request-response
    :status: draft

    The UDS application layer implements the request-response flow using per-ECU
    semaphores for serialization, a SID-specific lookup table for response matching,
    and a layered retry strategy split between the UDS and DoIP layers.

    **Per-ECU Semaphore**

    A semaphore with a permit count of 1 is allocated per ECU logical address. Because
    the key is the logical address, ECUs that share a logical address (e.g., before
    variant detection) implicitly share the same semaphore. The semaphore is acquired
    before the request is sent and held for the entire send-and-receive cycle, including
    any NRC-driven waiting or retransmission. It is released only after the final response
    is received or an error occurs.

    **Request Transmission**

    The UDS layer constructs a payload containing the tester source address, target ECU
    address, and UDS request data. This payload is passed to the DoIP transport layer
    for transmission. On DoIP-level transmission failure, retries are handled by the
    transport layer per ``CP_RepeatReqCountTrans``.

    **Response Matching Algorithm**

    Before sending, the UDS layer extracts a prefix of the request payload whose length
    is determined by a SID-to-length lookup table. This prefix is used to match the
    eventual response:

    .. list-table:: Response match length by SID
       :header-rows: 1
       :widths: 10 10 40

       * - SID
         - Length
         - Description
       * - ``0x14``
         - 1
         - ClearDiagnosticInformation (SID only)
       * - ``0x22``
         - 3
         - ReadDataByIdentifier (SID + 2-byte DID)
       * - ``0x2E``
         - 3
         - WriteDataByIdentifier (SID + 2-byte DID)
       * - ``0x31``
         - 4
         - RoutineControl (SID + sub-function + 2-byte RID)
       * - ``0x34``
         - 1
         - RequestDownload (SID only)
       * - ``0x35``
         - 1
         - RequestUpload (SID only)
       * - ``0x37``
         - 1
         - RequestTransferExit (SID only)
       * - default
         - 2
         - SID + sub-function byte (or similar)

    For a positive response, the first byte equals the sent SID plus ``0x40`` (ISO 14229
    positive response bitmask) and the subsequent bytes up to the match length equal the
    corresponding bytes of the original request. If the request payload is shorter than
    the SID-specific match length, the match is performed only up to the available payload
    length. For a negative response, the first byte is ``0x7F`` and the second byte
    equals the sent SID.

    NRC 0x78, 0x21, and 0x94 are parsed at the DoIP layer and delivered to the UDS layer
    as typed response variants. These are processed by the NRC handling logic
    (see :need:`arch~uds-nrc-handling`) before SID matching is applied to the final
    response.

    **Timeout and Retry Strategy**

    The caller may optionally override the default response timeout. When NRC 0x78 is
    received, the active timeout switches from ``CP_P6Max`` to ``CP_P6Star``. Application-
    layer retries (``CP_RepeatReqCountApp``) are independent of DoIP transport-layer
    retries (``CP_RepeatReqCountTrans``).

NRC Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. arch:: UDS NRC Handling
    :id: arch~uds-nrc-handling
    :status: draft

    The UDS application layer implements a dual-loop architecture for handling Negative
    Response Codes (NRCs). The outer loop handles retransmission (for NRC 0x21 and 0x94),
    while the inner loop handles continued waiting (for NRC 0x78). Each NRC type has an
    independent handling policy and timing configuration.

    **Dual-Loop Architecture**

    - **Outer loop** (``'send``): Transmits the UDS request to the DoIP layer. On NRC 0x21
      (Busy, Repeat Request) or NRC 0x94 (Temporarily Not Available), control returns to
      this loop after a configured delay, causing the request to be retransmitted.
    - **Inner loop** (``'read_uds_messages``): Waits for responses from the DoIP layer. On
      NRC 0x78 (Response Pending), the timeout is extended and the loop continues waiting
      without retransmission.

    **NRC 0x78 -- Response Pending**

    When the ECU signals NRC 0x78, it has accepted the request but needs more time. The
    CDA switches to the enhanced timeout ``CP_P6Star`` and continues waiting in the inner
    loop. The handling policy ``CP_RC78Handling`` determines behavior:

    - **Disabled (0)**: Do not handle; report as negative response.
    - **Continue until timeout (1)**: Keep waiting until ``CP_RC78CompletionTimeout``.
    - **Continue unlimited (2)**: Keep waiting indefinitely.

    **NRC 0x21 -- Busy, Repeat Request**

    When the ECU signals NRC 0x21, it is temporarily busy. The CDA waits for
    ``CP_RC21RequestTime`` and then retransmits the original request by breaking back to
    the outer loop. The handling policy ``CP_RC21Handling`` determines behavior:

    - **Disabled (0)**: Do not handle; report as negative response.
    - **Continue until timeout (1)**: Retry until ``CP_RC21CompletionTimeout``.
    - **Continue unlimited (2)**: Retry indefinitely.

    **NRC 0x94 -- Temporarily Not Available**

    When the ECU signals NRC 0x94, the requested resource is temporarily unavailable. The
    CDA waits for ``CP_RC94RequestTime`` and then retransmits the original request. The
    handling policy ``CP_RC94Handling`` determines behavior:

    - **Disabled (0)**: Do not handle; report as negative response.
    - **Continue until timeout (1)**: Retry until ``CP_RC94CompletionTimeout``.
    - **Continue unlimited (2)**: Retry indefinitely.

    **NRC Classification at Transport Layer**

    NRC 0x78, 0x21, and 0x94 are parsed at the DoIP transport layer and delivered to the
    UDS application layer as typed response variants (``ResponsePending``,
    ``BusyRepeatRequest``, ``TemporarilyNotAvailable``) rather than raw messages. This
    allows the UDS layer to apply the appropriate handling logic (retry, wait, or report)
    based on the NRC type and configured policy. All other NRCs are delivered as standard
    negative responses for SID-based matching.

    **Policy Validation**

    Before acting on any NRC, the CDA validates the handling policy and checks the elapsed
    time against the configured completion timeout. If the policy is disabled or the timeout
    has been exceeded, the NRC is reported to the caller as a terminal negative response.

Tester Present
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. arch:: UDS Tester Present
    :id: arch~uds-tester-present
    :status: draft

    The CDA maintains active diagnostic sessions with ECUs by periodically sending UDS
    Tester Present (``0x3E``) messages. Tester present generation is driven by the lock
    lifecycle: tasks are started when locks are acquired and stopped when locks are
    released.

    **Lock-Driven Lifecycle**

    Tester present tasks are tied to the SOVD lock mechanism:

    - **Component (ECU) lock**: Acquiring a lock on a single ECU starts a **physical**
      tester present task for that ECU, sending to the ECU's physical address.
    - **Functional group lock**: Acquiring a lock on a functional group starts
      **functional** tester present tasks for each gateway ECU in the group, sending to
      each gateway's functional address.
    - **Vehicle lock**: Does not start any tester present tasks.

    If ``CP_TesterPresentHandling`` is set to "Disabled" (0) for an ECU, no tester present
    task is started for that ECU regardless of the lock type.

    When a lock is released, the associated tester present tasks are stopped and the
    ECU's session and security access state are reset.

    **Duplicate Prevention**

    Active tester present tasks are tracked in a HashMap keyed by ECU name. Before
    starting a new task, the system checks whether a task already exists for that ECU.
    Only one tester present task (physical or functional) can be active per ECU at any
    time.

    **Task Implementation**

    Each tester present task is a background async task that runs a periodic loop:

    1. Wait for the configured interval (``CP_TesterPresentTime``, default 2 seconds).
    2. Construct the tester present message from ``CP_TesterPresentMessage`` and send it
       through the standard UDS send path.
    3. If ``CP_TesterPresentReqResp`` indicates a response is expected, await and validate
       the response.
    4. If sending takes longer than the interval, log an error and continue.

    The interval uses a delay-on-miss strategy: if a tick is missed (e.g., due to slow
    sending), the next tick is delayed rather than bursting to catch up.

    **Message Format**

    The tester present message is constructed from ``CP_TesterPresentMessage`` (default:
    ``[0x3E, 0x00]``). When ``CP_TesterPresentReqResp`` indicates no response is expected,
    the suppress-positive-response bit (``0x80``) is OR-ed onto the sub-function byte,
    producing ``[0x3E, 0x80]``. In this mode the message is sent with
    ``expect_response = false``, meaning the CDA waits only for the DoIP-level
    acknowledgement and does not await a UDS-level response. When a response is expected,
    the message is sent as-is and the CDA validates the response against
    ``CP_TesterPresentExpPosResp`` and ``CP_TesterPresentExpNegResp``.

    The target address depends on the tester present type:

    - **Physical** (ECU lock): Sent to the ECU's physical logical address.
    - **Functional** (functional group lock): Sent to the ECU's functional logical address.

    **Functional Group Resolution**

    When starting functional tester present, the system resolves the functional group to
    its member ECUs and starts individual tester present tasks for each **gateway** ECU
    in the group (ECUs whose logical address equals their gateway address). Each gateway
    receives its own dedicated background task sending to that gateway's functional address.

    **Error Handling**

    - Tester present NRCs received from the DoIP layer are logged at debug level but do
      not cause task termination. The tester present task continues sending on the next
      interval.
    - Send failures (e.g., connection loss) are handled by the standard UDS send path,
      which may trigger DoIP connection recovery. The tester present task continues
      attempting to send on subsequent intervals.

    **COM Parameter Usage**

    All tester present COM parameters are loaded from the diagnostic database per ECU. The
    tester present task evaluates them as follows:

    - ``CP_TesterPresentTime`` -- The sending interval in microseconds (default:
      2,000,000 µS = 2 s). The periodic loop waits this duration between sends.
    - ``CP_TesterPresentHandling`` -- Controls whether tester present messages are
      generated. When set to "Disabled" (0), no tester present task shall be started for
      the ECU even when a lock is held. When set to "Enabled" (1, default), tester present
      messages are generated normally.
    - ``CP_TesterPresentAddrMode`` -- Addressing mode for tester present messages. When
      set to "Physical" (0, default), messages are sent to the ECU's physical logical
      address. When set to "Functional" (1), messages are sent to the ECU's functional
      logical address. The lock type takes precedence: functional group locks always use
      functional addressing regardless of this parameter.
    - ``CP_TesterPresentReqResp`` -- Whether a UDS-level response is expected. When set
      to "No response expected" (0), the suppress-positive-response bit (sub-function
      ``0x80``) is set on the message and the task does not await a UDS-level response.
      When set to "Response expected" (1, default), the task awaits a response and
      validates it against the expected positive and negative response patterns.
    - ``CP_TesterPresentSendType`` -- Sending strategy. When set to "Fixed periodic" (0),
      tester present messages are sent at the configured interval regardless of other bus
      activity. When set to "On idle" (1, default), tester present messages are sent only
      when no other diagnostic communication has occurred on the connection within the
      interval defined by ``CP_TesterPresentTime``.
    - ``CP_TesterPresentMessage`` -- The raw message bytes for the tester present request
      (default: ``[0x3E, 0x00]``). When ``CP_TesterPresentReqResp`` indicates no response
      expected, the suppress-positive-response bit is OR-ed onto the sub-function byte
      (e.g., ``[0x3E, 0x00]`` becomes ``[0x3E, 0x80]``).
    - ``CP_TesterPresentExpPosResp`` -- Expected positive response bytes (default:
      ``[0x7E, 0x00]``). Used to validate the ECU response when ``CP_TesterPresentReqResp``
      indicates a response is expected.
    - ``CP_TesterPresentExpNegResp`` -- Expected negative response prefix (default:
      ``[0x7F, 0x3E]``). When a negative response is received, it is logged but does not
      cause the tester present task to stop.

    .. note::

        The current implementation uses only ``CP_TesterPresentTime`` at runtime. All other
        COM parameters are loaded from the database but are not yet evaluated. The
        implementation currently hardcodes the message as ``[0x3E, 0x80]`` (suppress
        positive response), uses fixed periodic sending, and always generates tester present
        when a lock is held.

Functional Communication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. arch:: UDS Functional Communication
    :id: arch~uds-functional-communication
    :status: draft

    The CDA supports functional group communication, where a single UDS request is sent
    to multiple ECUs simultaneously using functional addressing. ECUs are grouped by their
    gateway, and each gateway receives one functional request with responses collected from
    all ECUs behind it in parallel.

    **Functional Group Resolution**

    A functional group is resolved to its member ECUs from the diagnostic database. The
    following filters are applied:

    - Only physical ECUs are included (virtual/description ECUs are excluded).
    - Only ECUs that are currently online (detected during vehicle identification) are
      included.

    **Grouping by Gateway**

    ECUs in the functional group are grouped by their gateway logical address:

    - An ECU whose logical address equals its gateway address is the **gateway ECU** itself.
      It provides the UDS parameters, tester address, and functional address for its group.
    - ECUs whose logical address differs from their gateway address are placed **behind**
      the corresponding gateway.

    Each gateway group produces one diagnostic request targeted at the gateway's functional
    address (``CP_DoIPLogicalFunctionalAddress``).

    **Parallel Gateway Communication**

    When a functional group spans multiple gateways, the CDA sends to all gateways in
    parallel. For each gateway, the flow is:

    1. Construct a ``ServicePayload`` with the gateway's tester address as source and the
       functional address as target.
    2. Send the diagnostic message once to the gateway via the DoIP transport layer.
    3. Wait for responses from all expected ECUs behind the gateway, in parallel.

    **Response Collection**

    After the gateway accepts the functional request (DoIP ACK), the DoIP transport layer
    demultiplexes incoming responses by source address. Each ECU behind the gateway has its
    own receive channel, allowing responses to be collected concurrently. ECUs that do not
    respond within ``CP_P6Max`` are reported as individual timeout errors.

    **No NRC Handling on Functional Path**

    Unlike physical (unicast) communication, the functional communication path does not
    implement UDS-level NRC 0x21/0x78/0x94 handling. NRC responses on the functional path
    are returned as-is to the caller.
