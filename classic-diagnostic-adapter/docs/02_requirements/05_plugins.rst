* Validate and verify the JWT token from incoming HTTP Requests
* Utilize additional headers from the request
* Reject the incoming request
* Enhance the SOVD-request-context with data, this context can then be used in other addons

Paths
-----

A SOVD plugin must be able to:

* Add paths to the SOVD-API, and handle them
* Restructure existing path structures
* Modify existing path structures to run different code

Diagnostic Database Update Plugin
---------------------------------

.. req:: Diagnostic Database Update Plugin
    :id: req~plugin-diagnostic-database-update
    :links: arch~plugin-diagnostic-database-update
    :status: draft

    A diagnostic database update plugin must be available. It must provide an SOVD-API allowing clients to
    update the diagnostic database of the CDA atomically, meaning all provided files for the update are updated at
    the same time, and any failure during the update process fails the entire update, rolling back to the previous
    state of the diagnostic database.

    The plugin must be able to update the diagnostic database without restarting the CDA.


.. req:: Diagnostic Database Update Plugin - Authentication
    :id: req~plugin-diagnostic-database-update-authentication
    :links: arch~plugin-diagnostic-database-update
    :status: draft

    The diagnostic database update plugin must ensure that only authorized clients can update the diagnostic database.

    The exact mechanism (i.e. are calls to the endpoints allowed) must be providable to the plugin.


.. req:: Diagnostic Database Update Plugin - Verification
    :id: req~plugin-diagnostic-database-update-verification
    :links: arch~plugin-diagnostic-database-update
    :status: draft

    The diagnostic database update plugin must be able to verify the integrity of the mdd files before they are
    being used by the CDA.

    The exact mechanism (e.g. signature & hash verification) must be providable to the plugin.


.. req:: Diagnostic Database Update Plugin - Downgrade Protection
    :id: req~plugin-diagnostic-database-update-downgrade-protection
    :links: arch~plugin-diagnostic-database-update
    :status: draft

    The diagnostic database update plugin must have the option to prevent downgrades of the diagnostic database,
    meaning that it can prevent applying an update which would lead to an older version of the diagnostic database
    being active than the currently active one.

    The exact mechanism (e.g. version determination, persistence of versions for deleted entries) must be
    providable to the plugin.

.. req:: Diagnostic Database Update Plugin - Safety
    :id: req~plugin-diagnostic-database-update-safety
    :links: arch~plugin-diagnostic-database-update
    :status: draft

    Updates to the diagnostic database must be safe, it must be ensured that the CDA can recover from
    power-cycles or crashes at any time during the update process, and that the CDA is not left in an unusable state.
