Communication Parameters (ComParams)
------------------------------------

.. arch:: Communication Parameters API
    :id: arch~sovd-api-comparams
    :links: arch~sovd-api-comparams-without-lock
    :status: draft

    .. note::
       Communication parameter handling is exposed through a ``comparam`` endpoint in ``operations``.

    **Motivation**

    When using the CDA to communicate with classic ECUs, a client needs the ability to modify the communication parameters like timeouts and retries on-the-fly. This API provides a way to do this.

    **Retrieving & Modifying with a lock**

    .. list-table:: ComParam operations
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Method
         - Path
         - Description
       * - POST
         - /operations/comparam/executions
         - Creates an id, can also directly contain parameters to be modified
       * - GET
         - /operations/comparam/executions/{id}
         - Returns the current communication parameters
       * - PUT
         - /operations/comparam/executions/{id}
         - Modifies the communication parameters
       * - DELETE
         - /operations/comparam/executions/{id}
         - Resets the communication parameters to their original state

    These operations require a lock on the entity. Only one execution of communication parameters per entity is allowed.

.. arch:: Retrieve Communication Parameters without Lock
    :id: arch~sovd-api-comparams-without-lock
    :status: draft

    .. note::
       This is a small extension to the ISO standard

    To allow retrieving the communication parameters without a lock, a GET on ``/operations/comparam?todo`` must
    also return the current parameters.

    .. todo:: this conflicts with the SOVD standard of returning a list of items below that path - define additional query parameter for data?

    **Rationale**

    Clients without a lock might want to log the current communication parameters for informational
    purposes, so they should be able to retrieve them.

    Handling this with the POST/GET semantic with only a single execution would make the handling
    extremely complicated for parallel clients with & without locks.

    Example for directly retrieving communication parameters:

    .. code:: json

       {
         "item": {
           "id": "comparam",
           "name": "Communication parameters",
           "asynchronous_execution": true,
           "proximity_proof_required": false
         },
         "parameters": {
           "CP_P6Max": {
             "value": "4500000",
             "unit": {
               "factor_to_si_unit": 1e-06
             }
           },
           "CP_RC78Handling": {
             "value": "Continue until RC78 timeout"
           },
           "...": {
             "...": "..."
           }
         }
       }

.. todo:: openapi schema

.. todo:: Maybe move unit/types into schema with include-schema?
