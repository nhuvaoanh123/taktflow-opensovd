Single ECU Jobs
---------------

.. arch:: Single ECU Jobs Extension
    :id: arch~sovd-api-single-ecu-jobs
    :status: draft

    **Motivation**

    When a client wants to replace the classical single-ecu-jobs defined in the odx description, it could need the original input/output parameters from those jobs. This API provides access to the data for the single-ecu-jobs, which were present in the original odx at the time of conversion.

    **Retrieving data**

    .. note::
       The available data may depend on the currently detected variant, since the ecu jobs are defined for variants.

    The following paths will be available within the ``/components/{ecuName}`` path:

    .. list-table:: Single ECU Jobs endpoints
       :header-rows: 1
