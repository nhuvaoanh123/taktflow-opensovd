SOVD (ISO 17978-1)
==================

The guiding principle behind this document is to specify the requirements for an ISO 17978-1 compatible API in the Eclipse OpenSOVD Classic Diagnostic Adapter (CDA).

General
-------

Paths and parameter names should be case-insensitive, unless otherwise mentioned.

HTTP(S)
-------

.. req:: HTTP-Server
    :id: req~sovd-api-http-server
    :links: arch~sovd-api-http-server
    :status: draft

    The CDA must provide an HTTP- or HTTPS-server.

    The HTTP Server has to support multiple connections, and calls should be handled asynchronously.

    **Rationale**

    Multiple clients might use the CDA at the same time, and asynchronous handling generally improves performance due to reduced thread count.


.. req:: HTTP-Server-Port
    :id: req~sovd-api-http-server-port
    :status: draft

    The HTTP- or HTTPS-Server port must be configurable.


.. req:: HTTPS-Server configuration
    :id: req~sovd-api-https-server-configuration
    :status: draft

    In case of HTTPS, the certificate/key must be providable through the configuration, or a plugin.

    **Rationale**

    Certificates/Keys might be stored in an HSM, therefore platform specific code might be needed for access.

    .. todo:: Maybe connection establishment/encryption also needs to be done through HSM?


API
---

Entities
^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Entity Data Types
    :id: req~sovd-api-data-types-mapping-iso17978
    :links: arch~sovd-api-data-types-mapping-iso17978
    :status: draft

    Data types must be mapped as specified by ISO 17978-3.

    Additionally, for the data type ``A_BYTEFIELD``, the format ``hex`` must be supported - see :ref:`requirements_sovd_api_bytefield_as_hex`.

Paths
^^^^^

.. req:: Components Entity Collection
    :id: req~sovd-api-components-entity-collection
    :links: arch~sovd-api-components-entity-collection
    :status: draft

    The CDA must provide a ``/components`` endpoint that exposes the available ECUs as an entity collection.

    Each ECU with a loaded diagnostic description (MDD file) must be represented as an entity in the collection.

    - A ``GET`` on ``/components`` must return a list of all available ECU entities, with each ECU having the following properties:
      - ``id`` - Identifier of the ECU (as used in path, typically lower-case ecu name)
      - ``name`` - Name of the ECU as in the diagnostic description
      - ``href`` - uri-reference to the ECUs standardized resource collection

    **Rationale**

    The ``/components`` endpoint provides the entry point for clients to discover the available ECUs and their capabilities. This is the primary mechanism for a client to enumerate the diagnostic targets accessible through the CDA.


.. req:: Standardized Resource Collection Mapping
    :id: req~sovd-api-standardized-resource-collection-mapping
    :links: arch~sovd-api-standardized-resource-collection-mapping
    :status: draft

    The standardized resource collection for ``/components/{ecu-name}`` must be mapped as follows:

    .. list-table:: UDS SID to REST path mapping
       :header-rows: 1
       :widths: 15 45 40

       * - SID (base 16)
         - REST path
         - Comment
       * - 10
         - /modes/session
         -
       * - 11
         - | /operations/reset
           | /status/restart
         -
       * - | 14
           | 19
         - /faults/
         -
       * - | 22
           | 2E
         - | /data/{data-identifier}
           | /configurations/{data-identifier}
         - category & classification between paths is handled by the functional class with configuration
       * - 27
         - /modes/security
         -
       * - 28
         - /modes/commctrl
         -
       * - 29
         - /modes/authentication
         -
       * - 31
         - /operations/{routine-identifier}
         -
       * - | 34
           | 36
           | 37
         - | /x-sovd2uds-download/requestdownload
           | /x-sovd2uds-download/flashtransfer
           | /x-sovd2uds-download/transferexit
         - ``flashtransfer`` handles the whole transfer, not for individual calls
       * - 3E
         - --
         - handled internally by CDA
       * - 85
         - /modes/dtcsetting
         -

    NOTE: The mapping in ISO standard is inconsistent w.r.t. ``/modes/security`` and ``/modes/authentication``

    **Query Parameters**

    The CDA must support the optional query parameter ``x-sovd2uds-includesdgs`` (alias ``x-include-sdgs``) to be able to
    include a list of SDG/SD properties of the ECU - see :need:`req~sovd-api-component-sdgsd`.

.. req:: Component SDG/SDs
    :id: req~sovd-api-component-sdgsd
    :links: arch~sovd-api-component-sdgsd
    :status: draft

    The CDA must return the Special Data Groups (SDGs) and Special Data (SDs) from the diagnostic description when the
    optional query parameter ``x-sovd2uds-includesdgs`` (alias ``x-include-sdgs``) is set to ``true``.

    This query parameter must be supported on:

    - ``GET /components/{ecu-name}`` -- returns the ECU-level SDGs in an ``sdgs`` property on the component response.
    - ``GET /components/{ecu-name}/data/{data-identifier}`` -- returns the service-level SDGs instead of the normal data response.
    - ``GET /components/{ecu-name}/operations/{operation-identifier}`` -- returns the service-level SDGs instead of the normal data response.

    The ``sdgs`` property must contain a list of SDG/SD entries. Each entry is either:

    - An **SD** (Special Data) with the following optional fields:

      - ``value`` -- the value of the SD
      - ``si`` -- semantic information (description)
      - ``ti`` -- text information

    - An **SDG** (Special Data Group) with the following optional fields:

      - ``caption`` -- the name of the SDG
      - ``si`` -- semantic information (description)
      - ``sdgs`` -- a nested list of SD and SDG entries (recursive structure)

    When no SDGs are available for the requested resource, the ``sdgs`` property must be an empty list or omitted.

    **Rationale**

    SDGs carry vendor-specific metadata from the diagnostic description (e.g. bus interface type, AUTOSAR version) that
    clients may need for display or decision-making purposes. Making them opt-in through a query parameter avoids
    unnecessary overhead in the default response.


.. req:: Explicit ECU Variant Detection
    :id: req~sovd-api-ecu-variant-detection
    :links: arch~sovd-api-ecu-variant-detection
    :status: draft

    The CDA must support ECU variant detection through a ``POST`` on the ``/components/{ecu-name}`` endpoint.
    An additional endpoint under operations may be provided to trigger the detection.

    **Rationale**

    Some ECUs have different variants, which support different functionality. To provide the correct functionality,
    the CDA needs to be able to detect the variant in use. This variant may change at any point due to the nature of
    the ECUs software. Clients may need to trigger this explicitly to ensure correct functionality.


Operations
""""""""""

.. req:: Operations Handling
    :id: req~sovd-api-operations-handling
    :links: arch~sovd-api-operations-handling
    :status: draft

    Operations (Routines SID 31\ :sub:`16`) can be synchronous or asynchronous. Asynchronous routines are routines, for which the ``RequestResults`` and/or ``Stop`` subfunctions are defined.

    The order of operations:

    1. ``POST /executions`` for *Start* (subfunction 01)
    2. ``GET /executions/{id}`` for *RequestResults* (subfunction 03)
    3. ``DELETE /executions/{id}`` for *Stop* (subfunction 02).

    **Synchronous routines**

    The `POST` to executions will directly return the result - either a 200 with the data, or an error.

    Example of a successful call:

    .. code:: javascript

        {
          "parameters": {
              "key": "value"
          }
        }


    **Asynchronous routines**

    Since the response of the ``Start`` subfunction, as well as an id for polling the ``RequestResults``
    subfunction are required, both must be returned.

    Example of a successful call:

    .. code:: javascript

        {
          "id": "<id of created execution>",
          "status": "running",
          "parameters": {
              "key": "value"
          }
        }


    Should the call to the ``Start`` subfunction return an error (e.g. NRC), no ``id`` for polling is created.

    There are however use-cases, in which you may want to call ``RequestResults`` or ``Stop`` independently, or there could
    only be partial definitions (e.g. only Stop). For this use case the extension :ref:`requirements_sovd_api_operation_order` is required.

Faults
""""""

.. req:: Faults Endpoint
    :id: req~sovd-api-faults-endpoint
    :links: arch~sovd-api-faults-endpoint
    :status: draft

    The CDA must provide a ``/faults`` endpoint to retrieve DTCs in accordance with ISO 17978-3.


Extensions to the ISO specification
-----------------------------------

.. _requirements_sovd_api_bytefield_as_hex:

Data Type A_BYTEFIELD as Hex
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Data Type A_BYTEFIELD as Hex
    :id: req~sovd-api-bytefield-as-hex
    :status: draft

    For the data type ``A_BYTEFIELD`` the json output type ``string`` with the format ``hex`` must be supported
    through an optional query-parameter. Using ``hex`` means, that the binary data must be base16-encoded,
    either with or without preceding ``0x`` prefixes.

    **Rationale**

    Handling base64 encoded binary directly can be a compatibility challenge for offboard testers accessing the
    CDA. Manual debugging can also be simplified by directly seeing the hexadecimal encoded data, since it's
    easier to process for humans.

.. _requirements_sovd_api_mimetype_octet_stream:

Support for mimetype application/octet-stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Support for mimetype application/octet-stream
    :id: req~sovd-api-octet-stream-support
    :status: draft

    The ``/data/{data-identifier}`` and ``/operations/{routine-identifier}`` endpoints must support the additional mimetype octet-stream where applicable, to allow clients to send and receive payloads as binary data.

    NOTE: Only the payload is sent/received. The SID & DID/RID are derived from the path, and in case of NRCs only the NRC code (single byte) is sent back with a HTTP 502.

    **Rationale**

    This requirement simplifies the use of the CDA as a diagnostic tester and in migration scenarios.

Version endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Version Endpoint
    :id: req~sovd-api-version-endpoint
    :status: draft

    The CDA must provide a standardized version endpoint ``/apps/sovd2uds/data/version`` which returns the current
    version of the CDA in use, its SOVD api version, and implementation name.


Health Endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Health Monitoring Endpoint
    :id: req~sovd-api-health-endpoint
    :links: arch~dt-health-monitoring
    :status: draft

    The CDA MAY provide a health monitoring endpoint as an optional build-time feature.

    When the health monitoring feature is enabled:

    - The CDA must expose a health endpoint on the HTTP server that reports the aggregate health status
      of the application and its components
    - Each major component (main application, database loader, DoIP gateway) must register a health
      provider with granular status reporting
    - Health status must reflect the current initialization and operational state of monitored components
    - The health endpoint must be available immediately after the HTTP server starts, before
      SOVD API routes are registered

    When the health monitoring feature is disabled:

    - The CDA must not expose any health endpoints
    - The CDA may still use the health monitoring framework internally for logging or diagnostics, and for custom
       plugins to use, but it must not be accessible externally through the CDA itself
    - The absence of health monitoring must not affect any other CDA functionality

    **Rationale**

    Health monitoring enables external systems (e.g., container orchestrators, load balancers, or
    monitoring systems) to observe CDA startup progress and operational status. Making this an optional
    build-time feature allows deployments that do not require health monitoring to reduce the
    application footprint and avoid unnecessary overhead.


.. _requirements_sovd_api_operation_order:

Support for non-standard operation order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Support for non-standard operation order
    :id: req~sovd-api-routine-operation-out-of-order
    :status: draft

    To support the use-case of calling ``RequestResults`` and ``Stop``, without having to call ``Start``,
    the following boolean query parameters must be supported:

    .. list-table:: UDS SID to REST path mapping
       :header-rows: 1
       :widths: 20 40 40

       * - Method
         - Parameter
         - Description

       * - All
         - x-sovd2uds-suppressService
         - Suppresses sending the routine to the ECU

       * - DELETE
         - x-sovd2uds-force
         - Forces a DELETE operation to delete the id, regardless of an error the ecu might have reported for the `Stop` routine


    When a REST call is initiated that needs to call the service on the ECU, but is missing the required
    definition in the diagnostic description, and ``x-sovd2uds-suppressService`` isn't set to true,
    the REST call must fail.


.. _requirements_sovd_api_vehicle_api:

Vehicle
^^^^^^^

A vehicle must support operations as a whole, to allow for operations which affect the whole vehicle, like updating
mdd-files, or to prepare for operations which affect the whole vehicle (e.g. disabling vehicle communication).

.. req:: Vehicle Level Operations
    :id: req~sovd-api-vehicle-level-operations
    :status: draft

    Vehicle level operations must be supported in the CDA.
    This requires a standardized resource collection in the exposed root path ``/``.

    The standardized resource collection must provide the following resources:

    .. list-table:: Standardized resource collection
       :header-rows: 1
       :widths: 30 70

       * - Resource
         - Description
       * - locks
         - Locks affecting the whole vehicle
       * - functions
         - Functions affecting the whole vehicle (i.e. communication disable/enable)


.. _requirements_sovd_api_functional_communication:

Functional communication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Functional Communication
    :id: req~sovd-api-functional-communication
    :links: arch~functional-communication-dd-configuration
    :status: draft

    Functional communications needs to be possible. A standardized resource collection must be made available within the
    ``/functions/functionalgroups/{groupName}`` resource.

    The available functionality must be defined in an additional diagnostic description used solely for defining functional communication services. Since this file may contain multiple logical link definitions, a configuration option can be provided to filter the available links.

    The following entities must be available in the functional groups resource collection:

    .. list-table:: Functional groups entities
       :header-rows: 1
       :widths: 30 70

       * - Entity
         - Function
       * - locks
         - Locking a functional group (also controls functional tester present)
       * - operations
         - Calling functional routines
       * - data
         - Calling functional data services
       * - modes
         - Setting modes for the ecus in the functional group

    **Rationale**

    Clients require functional communication to ECUs for use-cases, in which they want to control communication or dtcsettings for all ecus.

.. _requirements_sovd_api_flash_api:

Flash API
^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Flash API
    :id: req~sovd-api-flashing
    :links: arch~sovd-api-flash-file-management, arch~sovd-api-flash-data-transfer
    :status: draft

    A Flash-API is required to support flashing of ECUs, utilizing SIDs 34\ :sub:`16`, 36\ :sub:`16` & 37\ :sub:`16`. It needs to enable efficient transfer of the data, without sending the individual data transfers via REST.

    Flashing is the process of updating the firmware of an ECU.

    **Rationale**

    Handling for the aforementioned SIDs isn't defined in the ISO specification, it is however an important use-case to be able to update the firmware on ECUs.

.. req:: Flash API - Data Source Restriction
    :id: req~sovd-api-flashing-security
    :status: draft

    The source of the data to be sent for flashing, must be restrictable to a path and its subdirectories via configuration.

    **Rationale**

    Without restrictions to the path, an attacker could exfiltrate arbitrary accessible data.

Communication Parameters API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Communication Parameters API
    :id: req~sovd-api-comparams
    :links: arch~sovd-api-comparams
    :status: draft

    An API to retrieve and modify communication parameters must be provided

    **Rationale**

    Clients need the ability to modify communication parameters on-the-fly to communicate with classic ECUs.

MDD Embedded files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: MDD Embedded files
    :id: req~sovd-api-mdd-embedded-files
    :links: arch~sovd-api-mdd-embedded-files
    :status: draft

    The CDA must support reading embedded files from the mdd file, and provide them via the ``/components/{ecu-name}/files/{file-name}`` endpoint.

    **Rationale**

    Some data required for communication with ECUs might be embedded in the mdd file. To allow clients to retrieve this data, it must be made available through the API.

Security
^^^^^^^^

Since vendors have different requirements and systems regarding security, security related functionality has to be
implemented in a plugin, see :ref:`requirements-plugins-security`.

Token validation
""""""""""""""""

.. todo:: define delegated responsibility to security plugin for checking the token and extracting/using the data

Audiences
"""""""""

.. todo:: define audiences, delegated responsibility to security plugin

Session States
""""""""""""""

.. todo:: define transitions, preconditions, and how they work/are checked


OpenAPI-Documentation
---------------------

.. req:: OpenAPI Documentation
    :id: req~sovd-api-openapi-documentation
    :status: draft

    An OpenAPI documentation of the provided API must be available for every endpoint of the CDA when ``/docs`` is appended.

    **Rationale**

    Required by the standard.


.. req:: OpenAPI Schema
    :id: req~sovd-api-openapi-schema
    :status: draft

    An OpenAPI schema description of the retrieved data must be included in the response when the query
    parameter ``include-schema=true`` is appended to any endpoint with returned data.

    **Rationale**

    Required by the standard.
