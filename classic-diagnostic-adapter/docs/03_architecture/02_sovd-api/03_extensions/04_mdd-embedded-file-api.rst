MDD Embedded Files API
----------------------

.. arch:: MDD Embedded Files API
    :id: arch~sovd-api-mdd-embedded-files
    :status: draft

    .. note::
       This is a SOVD-API extension.

    **Motivation**

    When an additional private SOVD-Server is tasked with providing functionality that replaces classic offboard-tester
    functionality, additional data from the single-ecu-jobs embedded in the original ``pdx``-file can be required.

    The odx-converter offers an option to include code-files from the pdx, as well as partial contents from those files.
    This API allows the retrieval of these files.

    **Embedded Content Retrieval**

    The API to retrieve embedded files utilizes a bulk-data endpoint, as defined in :ref:`architecture_bulk_data`

    Endpoints within ``/components/{ecuName}``:

    .. list-table:: MDD embedded files endpoints
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Method
         - Path
         - Description
       * - GET
         - /x-sovd2uds-bulk-data/mdd-embedded-files
         - Returns a list of items which represent the files and their metadata
       * - GET
         - /x-sovd2uds-bulk-data/mdd-embedded-files/{id}
         - Returns an item, which is the data that was embedded

    Other methods are not allowed (e.g. data can't be modified), and will return an HTTP 405 error code.

.. todo:: OpenAPI?

.. todo:: maybe move to a general bulk-data endpoint?
